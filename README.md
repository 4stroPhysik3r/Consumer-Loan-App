### Description
This simple Consumer Loan Application is a web application that allows customer to calculate the monthly payment for a consumer loan. The application is written in GO and only uses built-in functions

### Usage: how to run
```go run .``` to start the server at port 8080.
You can now visit the URL: http://localhost:8080/ or directly click the link in terminal.

### Implementation
The program calculates the given values and returns the monthly payment based on an interest rate of 5%. It also checks if the borrower is eligible for the loan. The borrower is eligible if he/she is not blacklisted and has not made more than 5 applications in the last 24 hours.

### Final thoughts
This is my first full web application written in GO. I learned a lot about back-end communication and web development in general.
